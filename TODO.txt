make or get a 16x16 of...

white noise (both purely random as well as a flat histogram? dunno)
blue noise
bayer
ign

show histogram?

note that you got bayer matrix from https://github.com/tromero/BayerMatrix

Note: ign and white noise can be full float instead of just U8. blue noise can be full float too but larger textures.
